//DESCRIPTION:
//We've defined a function countOnline which accepts one argument, allUsers. 
//Use a for...in statement inside this function to loop through the allUsers object 
//and return the number of users whose online property is set to true. An 
//example of an object which could be passed to countOnline is shown below. 
//Each user will have an online property set to either true or false.

//SOLUTION:

const users = {
  Alan: {
    online: false
  },
  Jeff: {
    online: true
  },
  Sarah: {
    online: false
  }
}

function countOnline(allUsers) {

 let result = 0;
  for (let user in allUsers) {
    if (allUsers[user].online === true) {
      result++;
    }
  }
return result
}

console.log(countOnline(users));
