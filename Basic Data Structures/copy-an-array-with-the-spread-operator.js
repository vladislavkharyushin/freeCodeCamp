//DESCRIPTION:
//We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as arguments. The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).
//copyMachine([true, false, true], 2) should return [[true, false, true], [true, false, true]]
//copyMachine([1, 2, 3], 5) should return [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
//copyMachine([true, true, null], 1) should return [[true, true, null]]
//copyMachine(["it works"], 3) should return [["it works"], ["it works"], ["it works"]]
//The copyMachine function should utilize the spread operator with array arr

//SOLUTION:

function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
 
newArr.push([...arr]);

    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));
