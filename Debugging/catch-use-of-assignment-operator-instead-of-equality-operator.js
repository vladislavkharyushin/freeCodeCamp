//DESCRIPTION:
//Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to result.
//Your code should fix the condition so it checks for equality, instead of using assignment.
//The condition should use either == or === to test for equality.

//SOLUTION:

let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x == y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);
