//DESCRIPTION:
//Fix the two indexing errors in the following function so all the numbers 1 through 5 are printed to the console.
//Your code should set the initial condition of the loop so it starts at the first index.
//Your code should fix the initial condition of the loop so that the index starts at 0.
//Your code should set the terminal condition of the loop so it stops at the last index.
//Your code should fix the terminal condition of the loop so that it stops at 1 before the length.

//SOLUTION:

function countToFive() {
  let firstFive = "12345";
  let len = firstFive.length;
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  // Only change code above this line
    console.log(firstFive[i]);
  }
}

countToFive();
